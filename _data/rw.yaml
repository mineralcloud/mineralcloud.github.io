description: Research in her group is devoted to computational quantum mechanical studies of materials. She addresses electronic, structural, and vibrational properties from a fundamental and inter-related perspective. She develops and applies simulation methods to investigate materials properties at high pressures and temperatures, particularly in mineral physics and geophysics, discovery of materials at ultra-high pressures, H2O-ice physics, complex oxides, and crystalline defects.
