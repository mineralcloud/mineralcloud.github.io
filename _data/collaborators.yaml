  description: Geoff Abers is a geophysicist who uses the tools of earthquake seismology to understand the forces, material cycles, and deep structure of the Earth. He uses modern seismic instrument arrays onshore and offshore to image high-resolution structure in the crust and mantle, and uses those images to understand the material and fluid cycles of the planet.
