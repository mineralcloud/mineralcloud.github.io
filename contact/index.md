# Position

Thank you for your interest in our group!

## Postdoctoral Associate

We are seeking to fill one postdoctoral position.

Successful candidates will have the opportunity to lead exciting projects that integrate advanced first principles methods.

The ideal candidate should demonstrate creativity, passion for scientific inquiry, and an ability to link fundamental science to real-world applications. The ideal candidate will also have:

1. An advanced degree in materials science and/or solid-state physics.
2. Experience with first principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics, density functional perturbation theory or GW.
3. Programming skills, preferably with experience in sustainable software development for robust widely used code bases.

## Graduate and undergraduate students

We are always looking for highly motivated graduate and undergraduate researchers to join our group. For PhDs and undergraduates, a lack of prior experience is not a significant concern. What we look for are individuals who have the drive, creativity and potential to do transformative research. Successful applicants will receive an extensive on-the-job training and mentoring program designed to maximize their potential.
