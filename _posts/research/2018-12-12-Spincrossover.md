Spin crossover of iron is of central importance in solid Earth geophysics. It impacts all physical properties of minerals that altogether constitute ∼ 95 vol% of the Earth's lower mantle: ferropericlase [(Mg,Fe)O] and Fe-bearing magnesium silicate (MgSiO<sub>3</sub>) perovskite.<sup>[1]</sup>

Using density functional theory+Hubbard U (DFT+U) calculations, we investigate how aluminum affects the spin crossover of iron in MgSiO<sub>3</sub> perovskite (Pv) and post-perovskite (Ppv), the major mineral phases in the Earth's lower mantle. We find that the presence of aluminum does not change the response of iron spin state to pressure: only ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) in the octahedral (B)-site undergoes a crossover from high-spin (HS) to low-spin (LS) state, while Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the dodecahedral (A)-site remains in the HS state, same as in Al-free cases. However, aluminum does significantly affect the placement of Fe<sup>3+</sup> in these mineral phases. The most stable atomic configuration has all Al<sup>3+</sup> in the B-site and all Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the A-site (thus in the HS state). Metastable configurations with LS Fe<sup>3+</sup> in the B-site can happen only at high pressures and high temperatures. Therefore, experimental observations of LS Fe3<sup>3+</sup> at high pressures in Al-bearing Pv require diffusion of iron from the A-site to the B-site and should be sensitive to the annealing temperature and schedule. In the Earth's lower mantle, the elastic anomalies accompanying the B-site HS-LS crossover exhibited in Al-free Pv are likely to be considerably reduced, according to the B-site Fe<sup>3+</sup> population.<sup>[2]</sup>
