# Installing the qha package
## 1 Installing using PyPI
qha can be installed via pip from PyPI.:

```bash
$ pip install qha
```

This will likely require the installation of a number of dependencies, including NumPy, will require a compiler to compile required bits of code, and can take a few minutes to complete.


## 2 Installing from source
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/MineralsCloud/qha/releases){:target="_blank"} , and go to the top-level directory, run:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```
