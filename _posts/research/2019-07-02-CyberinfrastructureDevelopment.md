Performing a state of the art study in geo- materials poses several challenges to both the human and the computer system:
1. Preparing and submitting 102â€“103 jobs.
2. Handling the huge workload imposed to the system. 
3. Monitoring hundreds of concurrently running jobs. 
4. Gathering relevant information scattered throughout hundreds or even thousands of output files from independent runs for further analysis.
5. Performing the analysis preferably without having to transfer data back to the user workstation.
